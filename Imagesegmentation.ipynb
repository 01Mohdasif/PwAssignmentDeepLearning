        "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments (regions or objects), making it easier to analyze and understand. The goal is to simplify the representation of an image or make it more meaningful and easier to analyze by segmenting the image into regions that are more uniform or have similar characteristics (such as color, texture, or intensity).\n",

        "1. **Occlusions**: Objects in an image may be partially hidden by other objects, making it difficult for segmentation algorithms to correctly identify the boundaries of occluded objects.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Using **multi-view** techniques (like stereo vision or depth sensing) can help detect occluded parts. **Contextual information** can also be leveraged to predict the occluded regions based on the surrounding visible parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Object Variability**: Objects in images can vary in appearance due to changes in lighting, pose, scale, or viewpoint, making segmentation harder.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Data augmentation techniques such as random scaling, rotation, and color jittering can help expose the model to more variations during training. Additionally, deep learning models like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** can learn to detect invariant features.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Boundary Ambiguity**: Defining precise boundaries between adjacent objects is a common challenge, particularly when objects have similar colors or textures.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Using advanced segmentation architectures like **U-Net** and **Mask R-CNN** that use multi-scale features and skip connections can help improve boundary detection. **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)** can also be used to refine the boundaries by considering pixel relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Noise and Artifacts**: Noise in the input images or artifacts introduced during the segmentation process can negatively affect segmentation performance.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Preprocessing techniques like denoising, using **Gaussian filters**, or applying **bilateral filtering** can help reduce the impact of noise.\n",

The architecture is characterized by **skip connections** that directly connect corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder, enabling precise localization.\n",
